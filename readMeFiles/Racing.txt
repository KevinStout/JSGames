Drive the car around the track:

Blue Car Controls:
    W = Move Forward
    A = Turn Left
    S = Move Back
    D = Turn Right

Green Car Controls:
    Up Arrow = Move Forward
    Left Arrow = Turn Left
    Down Arrow = Move Back
    Right Arrow = Turn Right

The car must be moving forward or back to Turn

Still need to fix how the cars interact with the finish line right now they act like walls.
This will be a simple thing to fix, just need to add a new rule, and another function call to say who wins the race/ start a new map.
